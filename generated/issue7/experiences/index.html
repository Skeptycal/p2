					<p>In this series we ask ThoughtWorkers to talk about a challenging time for them. A time when learning a new programming language challenged and then changed the way they thought.</p><p>This month, Korny tells us his story.</p><p>When I started using Clojure, it was a bit like a trip back in time. I learned to program in C. There you would put data into a struct, then use the right functions to manipulate it. This was of course risky and dangerous – structs were mutable, functions were ugly, and dispatching the right function to the right struct was complex and dangerous. Especially with no concept of unit testing. Then came OO, and C++. You could safely hide that struct from modification by putting it in an object, wrapping all mutation in methods, and dispatching to the right implementation through polymorphism. Problem solved.</p><p>Now we are in the future – we should have jet-packs and flying cars, but instead, along comes a language where you typically put data into maps (which look suspiciously like structs), and manipulate them with functions. However, this time it’s different: cunning data structures make the maps immutable <strong>and</strong> efficient; multimethods and higher-order functions mean you can dispatch the right functions to the right data however you like – and with protocols, you can even get a bit newfangled and dispatch that data based on it’s type.</p><p>Clojure really helped me revisit some of my assumptions. Nowadays in Ruby or JavaScript, or even in Java, instead of instinctively saying “how do I wrap that in an object?” I’ll consider whether OO is actually appropriate, or whether I can keep things simpler with data structures and a dash of FP. And I’ll try to stamp out mutable state wherever it might lurk.</p>
